;; Level 2
;;
;; ----------------------------------------
;;
;; Congratulations.  You have reached level 2.
;;
;; To get the password for level 3, write code to find the first prime
;; fibonacci number larger than a given minimum.  For example, the first
;; prime fibonacci number larger than 10 is 13.
;;
;; When you are ready, go here or call this automated
;; number (415) 799-9454.
;;
;; You will receive additional instructions at that time.  For the second portion
;; of this task, note that for the number 12 we consider the sum of the prime divisors
;; to be 2 + 3 = 5.  We do not include 2 twice even though it divides 12 twice.
