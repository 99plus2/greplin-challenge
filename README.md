# [The Greplin Programming Challenge](http://challenge.greplin.com/)

I found the "The Greplin Programming Challenge" from
reddit/programming, and really enjoyed solving it in python.

I decided it was a good practical way to get me to learn
clojure better, so I'm going to redo my python answers in
clojure.
