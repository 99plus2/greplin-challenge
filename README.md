# [The Greplin Programming Challenge](http://challenge.greplin.com/)

I found the [The Greplin Programming Challenge](http://challenge.greplin.com/) from
reddit/programming, and really enjoyed solving it in python.

I decided it was a good practical way to get me to learn
clojure better, so I'm going to redo my python answers in
clojure.

The clojure code is in: <http://github.com/krsanky/greplin-challenge/tree/master/greplin-challenge/>
It is a leiningen project.

### notes

- The clojure code for level-1 is painfully slow.
- One of the versions seems to handle 0 incorrectly for level-3
